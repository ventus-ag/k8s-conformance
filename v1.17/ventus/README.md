# How to reproduce

## 1. Create the Ventus Cloud account 
Open the https://portal.ventuscloud.eu/login and click to CREATE NEW ACCOUNT button.
Fill the form, add billing information, and your account will be granted by 100EUR credit.

Obtain more details about this step following the [Creating a new account instruction](https://ventuscloud.eu/docs/quickstarts/create-account).

## 2. Create a new API user
On the main Navigation Panel go to Cloud, choose API Users and click the (+) present in the lower right corner.
Fill the form and once a User is created, click the "Get OpenRC file" button to save this file.

Obtain more details about this steo following the [API Users instruction](https://ventuscloud.eu/docs/coretasks/api-users).

## 3. Create a new pair of SSH keys
On the main Navigation Panel go to Cloud and choose SSH Keys. 
Upload the SSH key or generate the new one using the (+) button from the bottom right.

Obtain more details about this step following the [SSH Keys instruction](https://ventuscloud.eu/docs/coretasks/ssh-keys).

## 4. Create a new cluster
On the main Navigation Panel go to Cloud, choose Clusters and click the (+) button present in the lower right corner.
Fill the form, push CREATE CLUSTER button and wait about 5 minutes for "Create Completed" status.

Obtain more details about this step following the [Kubernetes Cluster instruction](https://ventuscloud.eu/docs/Kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster).

## 5. Access the cluster
To access the cluster from your Ubuntu console install the openstack cli and run openrc file from the Step 2:
```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install python-openstackclient
sudo pip install python-magnumclient
. ./openrc
```
Now you're authorized to interact with your Ventus Cloud entities and you can get the kubeconfig file and the list of pods:
```
openstack coe cluster list
openstack coe cluster config <Name of Cluster>
export KUBECONFIG="./config"
kubectl get nodes --all-namespaces
```

Obtain more details about this step following the [Access your Kubernetes Cluster using CLI instruction](https://ventuscloud.eu/docs/Kubernetes/access-by-cli).

## 6. Run the tests
Download a [binary release](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases) of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster and instruct it to ignore master taints:

```
$ sonobuoy run --plugin-env=e2e.E2E_EXTRA_ARGS="--non-blocking-taints=CriticalAddonsOnly,dedicated" --mode=certified-conformance
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to
a local directory:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local `.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```
